One of the main challenges of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) is sourcing and processing high-quality training data, as organizations often store knowledge in multiple formats and locations. This information must be converted into a common format in an automated, structure approach. Docling is an open source tool that supports parsing and exporting documents to a common readable format. Organizations can then create a knowledge base for fine-tuning LLMs with InstructLab.

== Getting started

Many times developers don't have access to data or environments to try out new tools or solutions. Enabling developers to experiment with new tools and test solutions locally can speed up development and help prove out solutions before organizations make the decision to bring those tools into their development clusters.

This lab will walk you through the persona of a rock star developer that starts locally to build a solution to automate the collection of data files and generation of qna.yaml files for InstructLab. You'll then see how to take that solution locally and deploy it onto an enterprise OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI.
