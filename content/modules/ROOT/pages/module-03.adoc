== Granite Model Deployed to RHOAI

First, we'll start out by taking a look at where our Granite model is deployed on OpenShift AI. 

. Click on the OpenShift AI route provided for you. Click on the *Log in with OpenShift* button.

TODO - Put in screenshots of Granite deployed on RHOAI

== Open the Workbench

. Click on *Workbench*. We have one Jupyter notebook running named _elyra-docling-workbench_. 

+
NOTE: You can have multiple notebooks based on a variety of images per workbench. OpenShift AI provides Jupyter, VS Code,

. Click on the Git icon on the left menu and click *Clone a repository*.

+

+
Clone the https://github.com/noelo/instruct-generate repo as well.

+
You should now see the *elyra_docling_rh_summit* and *instruct_generate* directories in the file browser.

. We'll start by taking a look at our data science pipeline. 

+
Open the *elyra_docling_rh_summit/openshift_solution* directory and open the *docling_elyra_summit.pipeline*. Click on the *Ingest Files* node and then click on the *Open Panel* icon to view the node properties.

+

. Note that this node is using a different runtime image. The local pipeline used an Anaconda image. Also, instead of loading the files from a directory, this version of the node loads the files from an s3 bucket.

. Click on the *open runtimes* icon. This OpenShift AI workbench image has the Data Science Pipelines runtimes pre-configured. Note the Data Science Pipelines API Endpoint points to your OpenShift AI instance.

+
OpenShift AI Data Science Pipelines has a dependency on s3 object storage. We'll go over the s3 object store in upcoming sections.
